# ChessGamesSpreadsheets
Welcome to collection of chess games presented as animated xlsm spreadsheets. Inspired by works of Tatsuo Horiuchi "Michelangelo of Excel", we will try to convert famous games into spreadsheets and then animate them with the magic of Visual Basic for Applications (Excel) module and bring them to life.


# How to run?
Open Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook file. Enable Macro and click on play symbol. Thats it. Simple


# Why enable Macro?
Macros are Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module which runs the scripts. These chess game spreadsheets have a script to loop over all the worksheets in the workbook to animate the moves. You can enable macro to fully enjoy this artwork. Macros by default are disabled to avoid any malicious script. If you feel any security threat, normal xlsx files (without Macro) are also present, you can open them and use the short Ctrl + PageUp to animate the moves.
