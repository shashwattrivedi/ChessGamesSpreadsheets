# Opera Game
The Opera Game was an 1858 chess game played at an opera house in Paris, during Bellini's opera Norma, between the American chess master Paul Morphy and two strong amateurs: the German noble Karl II, Duke of Brunswick and the French aristocrat Comte Isouard de Vauvenargues. Duke Karl and Count Isouard consulted together, playing as partners against Morphy. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Game)
